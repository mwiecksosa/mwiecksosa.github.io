I am a third-year PhD Student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://www.stat.cmu.edu) at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu). I am lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). 

Here is my [CV](https://mwiecksosa.github.io/cv.pdf). You can reach me at mwiecksosa AT cmu DOT edu.

My research focuses on learning nonlinear dynamics from high-dimensional nonstationary time series data. I am especially interested in the connections between causality, optimal forecasting, and data-driven model predictive control. I am inspired by many topics in statistics and machine learning, notably nonparametric estimation, high-dimensional statistics, sequential analysis, deep neural networks, conditional independence testing, causal discovery, and observational causal inference.

**Working Papers**
1. Conditional Independence Testing in the Presence of Temporal Correlation and Nonstationarity (with Michel Haddad and Aaditya Ramdas). [Link](https://mwiecksosa.github.io/papers/dGCM_CI_NSTS.pdf).
- Summary: We introduce a general framework for conditional independence testing that is robust to both nonstationarity and temporal dependence. The key technical ingredients are time-varying regression estimation, time-varying covariance estimation, and a distribution-uniform strong Gaussian approximation for nonstationary time series.
2. Identifying Auxiliary Indicators in Unstable Forecasting Environments (with Michel Haddad and Aaditya Ramdas). *In progress, preliminary draft available upon request.*
- Summary: We develop a method for detecting new forecasting signals that can be used with nonstationary nonlinear time series.
3. Simulation-Based Inference for Models of Complex Temporal Systems (with Cosma Shalizi). *In progress.*
- Summary: We propose a method for inferring the parameters of analytically intractable models of complex temporal systems, drawing from nonstationary nonlinear time series theory.
4. Deep Learning for Nonstationary Nonlinear Time Series (with Wei Biao Wu). *In progress.*
- Summary: We present a theoretical framework for estimating the time-varying regression functions of nonstationary nonlinear time series using deep neural networks.
