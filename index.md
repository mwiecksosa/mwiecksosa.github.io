I am a second year PhD Student in the [Department of Statistics](www.stat.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](www.cmu.edu/). I am lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). Here is my [CV](mwiecksosa.github.io/cv.pdf). My email address is mwiecksosa AT cmu DOT edu. 

I am working on causal inference, causal discovery, and conditional independence testing for high-dimensional non-stationary time series. My work is primarily motivated by applications in the earth sciences, epidemiology, and macroeconomics.
