I am a third year PhD Student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). I am lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). Here is my [CV](https://mwiecksosa.github.io/cv.pdf). My email address is mwiecksosa AT cmu DOT edu. 

I am mainly interested in theory and methods for high-dimensional non-stationary nonlinear time series. I am currently working on a framework for assumption-weak discovery of forecasting signals. My work is primarily motivated by applications in the earth sciences and epidemiology.
