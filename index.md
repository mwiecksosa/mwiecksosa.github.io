I am a third year PhD Student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu). I am lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). Here is my [CV](https://mwiecksosa.github.io/cv.pdf). My email address is mwiecksosa AT cmu DOT edu. 

My research is about detecting and quantifying dynamic relationships between nonstationary nonlinear time series.
