I am a Statistics PhD Student in the [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). I am lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). Here is my [CV](https://github.com/mwiecksosa/cv/blob/main/CV_WieckSosaMichael_2024.pdf). My email address is mwiecksosa AT cmu DOT edu.

I am working on causal inference, causal discovery, and conditional independence testing for high-dimensional non-stationary time series. My work is primarily motivated by applications in the earth sciences, epidemiology, and macroeconomics.
