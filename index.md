I am a fourth-year PhD Student in the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](https://www.stat.cmu.edu) at [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu). I am lucky to be advised by [Aaditya Ramdas](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~aramdas/). 

Here is my [CV](https://mwiecksosa.github.io/cv.pdf). You can reach me at mwiecksosa AT cmu DOT edu.

**Working Papers**
1. Conditional independence testing with a single realization of a multivariate nonstationary nonlinear time series (with Michel F. C. Haddad and Aaditya Ramdas). 
- Summary: We introduce a general framework for conditional independence testing for nonstationary time series based on time-varying nonlinear regression and distribution-uniform strong Gaussian approximations.
- Links: [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21647).
2. Identifying relevant forecasting signals in unstable environments (with Michel F. C. Haddad and Aaditya Ramdas). 
- Summary: We develop a method for selecting variables for forecasting with nonstationary nonlinear time series.
3. Simulation-based estimation of dynamic models by matching random features (with Cosma Shalizi). 
- Summary: We introduce a parameter estimation framework for parametric models of stochastic processes that are analytically intractable.
4. Deep learning for nonstationary nonlinear time series (with Wei Biao Wu). 
- Summary: We present a theoretical framework for estimating the time-varying regression functions of nonstationary nonlinear time series using deep neural networks.
